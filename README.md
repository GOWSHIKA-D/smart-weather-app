### ✅ Pro Tips:

- If you made a **Streamlit version** of the weather app too, I can tailor a README for that.
- Want a `requirements.txt` or deployment instructions (e.g., GitHub Pages or Netlify)? Just ask!

Would you like me to generate one more README for your **Currency Converter** or other projects too?
